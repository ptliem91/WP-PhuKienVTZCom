== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WCPT, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WooCommerce Product Table” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I replace my default WooCommerce shop grid with a product table? =

There are 2 ways to achieve this:

1. Use the **Archive Override** facility available in WCPT PRO. This facility lets you replace default woocommerce grids with product tables on all your archive pages like Shop / Category / Tag / Attribute. The facility is located in WP Dashboard > Product Tables > Settings > Archive Override. The process is simple and most themes are already compatible. To check if your theme is compatible contact [support](https://wcproducttable.com/support/).

2. The alternative is to use any wordpress redirect plugin that lets you redirect shoppers from yout current shop page to the new shop page you have created with your WCPT table. However, please note that using this 'redirect rules' method can have some SEO impact as search engines do not prefer redirects.

= How do I create a new table? =

You can find full step-by-step tutorials on creating different kinds of tables along with video and annotated screenshots at the [WooCommerce Product Table tutorial](https://wcproducttable.com/tutorials/) page. The process is simple and convenient. Absolutely anyone can follow along with the tutorials.

If you have any issue at all in creating your product table, please feel free to reach out for [support](https://wcproducttable.com/support/) and I will bet happy to help! :)

= Do I have to setup separate columns for laptop, tablet and phone? =

Only Laptop Columns are 'required'. Tablet and Phone Columns are completely optional. Using the Tablet and Phone Columns you can fine-tune the table design for smaller devices. If you leave them empty, they will simply use the same column structure as the device above them ( Laptop > Tablet > Phone ).

= How do I unlock the PRO features? =

You can purchase a license for [WooCommerce Product Table PRO](http://pro.wcproducttable.com) here. It provides [several powerful features](https://www.notion.so/WCPT-PRO-Features-88d026542a2245719a71c33649c3f3d2) to create tables with fantastic user experience. It is available at an introductory price for now, so get it soon!
